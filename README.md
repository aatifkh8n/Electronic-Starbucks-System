# Electronic-Starbucks-System
This project requires the creation of an assumed computerized Starbucks administration system. The code will run through a GUI interface. The system is a safe and convenient place to perform online access for users’ account info and records, memberships purchases (assume you can perform), and top-up their “StarbucksAccounts”.
